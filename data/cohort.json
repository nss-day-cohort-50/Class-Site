Finally, I decided to pick up what I thought to be a lost dream. When we were at the hospital where my wife was giving birth to our first child I began to learn how to write in the SWIFT language. I ate up everything related to software and web development. So much so that I decided to make a career change to become a software developer. I chose to go to Nashville Software School because of their strong track record of success and the 6 month time table was ideal for my situation. During my time at NSS I have had the opportunity to develop software in several languages such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django, and SQL. I am on track to graduate from NSS on Jan 10th 2022. I am looking for a junior software development job in the Nashville area. I have a passion for software development and a love of learning. I am a driven individual who doesn’t give up until the job is done.</p>",
